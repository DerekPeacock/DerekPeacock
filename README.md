### Hi there I am Derek ðŸ‘‹

I have been programming for over 50 years, and teaching for over 40 years.
I specialise in ASP.NET Core MVC, although I have written programs in over 23 languages.
I have created multiple websites with database back ends, various games, and systems to support teaching of computing.

I play tennis, I have recorded in a choir in Abbey Road Studios, and I also been in the audience for Stricly Come Dancing, and met a number of the professional dancers as well as Craig RH.
