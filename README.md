### Hi there I am Derek ðŸ‘‹

I specialise in web applications using ASP.NET Core MVC, Razor and Blazor in C#.
I have created multiple websites with database back ends, various games, and systems to support the teaching of computing.

I play tennis, I have recorded in a choir in Abbey Road Studios, and I also been in the audience for Stricly Come Dancing, and met a number of the professional dancers as well as Craig RH.
